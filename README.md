  **"Harnessing multi-sensor spectral indices to monitor crop resilience, climate-driven drought, and the biophysical health of the Sundarbans Mangrove ecosystem."**

  **Project Overview:**  
  A comprehensive analytical suite developed in Google Earth Engine to monitor Earth's "green pulse." This repository integrates various vegetation indices (NDVI, VCI, EVI) to solve complex problems across agricultural productivity, disaster management, and coastal ecology.

  **Core Research Modules:**
  *   **Agro-Climatology:** Analyzing the impact of high-temperature anomalies on crop growth and modeling **Evapotranspiration (ET)** to identify crop water stress and irrigation needs.
  *   **Drought Intelligence:** Implementing **Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)** for high-resolution drought zonation and longitudinal monitoring of stressed agricultural zones.
  *   **Mangrove Ecosystem Research:** Estimating Above-Ground Biomass and chlorophyll content within the **Sundarbans Mangrove Forest** using data-fusion techniques.
  *   **Dynamic Visualizations:** Developing **MODIS NDVI time-series animations** and spatial zonation to visualize seasonal phenology and decadal vegetation shifts.
  
  **Planning & Eco-Governance:**  
  Provides foundational data for **Climate Adaptation Planning** and **Coastal Management**, supporting the conservation of biodiversity and the optimization of food security in climate-vulnerable regions.
